# University_student-data-analysis-by-Machine-Learning
The project analyzes and predicts university students' Overall Satisfaction Index (OSI) based on criteria such as GPA, age, extracurricular engagement, stress levels, and more. A Google Form survey was used to collect the data, which included numerous indices that influence student life. To get insights and create prediction models, the project employs data visualization, data cleaning, and machine learning approaches.

Project Overview
Data Collection: The dataset is made up of university student responses collected using Google Forms, which contain indicators such as academic performance, extracurricular activities, socioeconomic background, sleep patterns, and more.

Data Cleaning: Completed complete data cleaning to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset, assuring data quality and integrity.

Data Visualization: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn tools to visualize major trends and correlations between variables. The visualizations aid in understanding the effects of numerous factors on student happiness.

Machine Learning Models: We used various machine learning models, such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor, to predict students' OSI based on input variables.
Linear Regression yielded the best findings (RÂ² = 0.99), demonstrating a strong linear link between characteristics and OSI.
Models such as Decision Tree and Random Forest underperformed, illustrating the usefulness of simpler models when the connection between features is primarily linear.
